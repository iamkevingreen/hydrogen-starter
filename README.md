# Superhi Hydrogen v1.

This is a reduced starter from the Shopify hydrogen demo-store, I found the demo-store to be a little overwhelming and want to pair back some of that experience in order to give you a good starting place that we can build on together. I highly recommend checking out the Hydrogen getting started as well as the demo-store, I'll be explainining similar things just in my own way!
